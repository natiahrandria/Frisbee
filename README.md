# Frisbee

Our final term project has two codes, and they are in the "Code" file.

1. GoldenRatioFrisbee.java is used to find the optimal angle for the furthest distance (optimization)

2. Frisbee.java uses the best angle from GoldenRatioFrisbee.java to print the position of the frisbee on the x-axis and y-axis as a function of time.
(Then, we use excel to graph the trajectory of the frisbee.) 

*** NOTES: Before running Frisbee.java, modify the location on line 45 to make sure it sends the data to FrisbeeTrajectory.data which is in the same file as Frisbee.java.
